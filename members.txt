Jeevan Tewari (jmt62) - created ER diagram, fake dataset, and schema. Helped
with queries conceptually and general website design. Feels like every member
contributed equally well and that good progress was made.

Rebecca Shu (rjs73) - helped brainstorm different functions, ideas, and queries 
for the web application itself, helped write the load file, contributed in 
creating the fake dataset for possible goods, did research and helped find 
different APIs for our web application, and wrote up the progress report.
